# ProbesBeforeCrew
A Mod for Kerbal Space Program

I no longer maintain this repo.

I've handed over github maintenance and contributor liason to Moonlington (aka Floretta on the forums).

They will work with you, review your patch, and polish it before sending it to me for final review. 

After review I will push the latest version of PBC to the official Spacedock download link posted in my forum thread (https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/181013-ksp-18-112-probes-before-crew-pbc-version-293/). So your main install should still be downloaded via Spacedock and not the github repo, if you don't intend to beta test.

If you'd like to contribute patches for PBC submit them here.
